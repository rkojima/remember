Logic of signup/login/logout:

server opens
user opens html/css/js page of signup/login
user inputs signup (a POST request) or login(GET request)
sends HTTP data over to server
checking happens
server sends stuff back, whether signup/login worked or not
if signup/login works, server leads them to link of their homepage (e.g. "www.somethinghere.com/dashboard") as well as sending some html/css
